#### Experience
---
[**DB Lab instructor BME**](https://www.db.bme.hu/databases/)
 *September 2024 – Present*
	- Assisted students with SQL and database concepts, guiding lab assignments.
	- Published a [FAQ website](https://klevisimeri.github.io/DB-Lab/) to address common questions.
	- Reviewed lab entry tests for clarity and accuracy.

**Competitive Programmer**
 *January 2023 - Present*
	- Part of BME’s [Vprog](https://vprog.hu/) competitive programming group, achieving 2nd place in [ICPC Hungary](https://cs.bme.hu/icpc/posts/2024-10-01-icpc-hungary/) and advancing to [CERC 2023 regionals](https://cerc.acm.si/).
	- Developed strong skills in algorithms, data structures, runtime analysis, and efficient  implementation of them.
	- Daily participation in the [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) competitions.
	- Weekly participation in [Vprog Advance](https://vprog.hu/calendar/) (live sessions discussing algorithms with my peers at BME)
#### Projects
---
[**SimFN**](https://github.com/KlevisImeri/SimFN) & [Integrator2](https://github.com/KlevisImeri/Integrator2) (Java,C/C++)
- A graphing calculator that takes string input to plot functions.
- I had to build a:
	- **Lexer (Tokenizer)**: Breaks down the string into keywords.
	- **Parser**: Created an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using the [shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) to convert infix notation to postfix for easier tree construction.
	- **Evaluator**: The function that evaluates the AST for various input values.
- Everything, including the AST, was implemented from scratch.
- Swing was used for the GUI.
- This experience taught me the fundamentals of language creation and semantics in Java using an object-oriented paradigm.
- **Integrator2** is an older version of this project implemented in C and C++, which also includes function integration.
