Dear Professor,\

I am writing this email to adress some issues regarding the avaibility of the material for the lab. 
I have been using C/C++ all my life, from my ptoject to ui to even writiing fast backend API's. I am the "Do it yourself guy!". The syntax I use is C like (not even operator overloading). So the language is simple to read. 
In the other hand I don't have experience with python and the rich packages it provides. I don't have it or dislike it. For me it's just another tool, but the problem i am trying to mention is that I am having a very hard time reading it (maybe I am just not used to it). I find it hard cause:
- I am not used to non static typed languages
- Numpy has so many opperater overloadings most of the time I just have to debug what is actually happening cause I don't have the slitest idea just by reading the code what kind of array my result is or what kind of operation on the array does that operator do.
I have to ask so many questions during the labs for nearly many things to actually understand what the code is doing, and the problem is that we don't have much time for that. The pracitce teacher as he should is trying to explain everything in the lab before the exam and if I asked every quesitio I have we would not be able to finish it on time. 
The other thing is that I literally depend in his ability to explain the labs for that amount of time. He doesn't explain things bad, but for the way I like to understand everything line by line and go on my own pace. I dont want to be rude, but he missed so part today when he was scrolling (but who nodes maybe i fazed out, but i literally sit in the first row) so that is the only mistake I made in the lab exam. 
The problem is there is no way for me to actually prepare for the lab which is under my control. I am literally going blind and hoping the practice teacher explain everything perfectly so I don't mistake in the lab test.  
I genuily think that not having the oppertunity to prepare for the labs is wrong and not justified. If I am here to learn why should there be a problem for me to prepare before hand.

This are the reasons i kindly ask to at least have some time to prepare for the lab material.

Best Regards,

Dear Professor,

I am writing to address some issues regarding the availability of the lab material.

I have been using C/C++ throughout my life, from personal projects to UI design, and even writing fast backend APIs. I'm very much a "do it yourself" kind of person, and my coding style is C-like (I don't even use operator overloading), making my code simple and easy to read. However, I don't have much experience with Python or the rich packages it provides. It's not that I dislike it, in contrary I like it a lot. For me, it's just another nice tool. But the problem I'm facing is that I find it hard to read.

The main reasons are:

- I'm not used to non-statically typed languages.
- Numpy, in particular, has so many operator overloads that I often have to debug to understand whatâ€™s actually happening. Just by reading the code, I often have no idea what type of array Iâ€™m dealing with, or what kind of operation a particular operator is performing.

As a result, I have to ask a lot of questions during labs just to grasp what the code is doing. Unfortunately, thereâ€™s not much time for this. The practice teacher is trying to explain everything in the lab before the exam, and if I asked every question I had, we wouldnâ€™t finish on time.

Another issue is that I depend heavily on the practice teacherâ€™s explanations, and while he explains things well, I like to understand everything line by line and at my own pace. I donâ€™t want to be rude, but today, the teacher missed some parts while scrolling (or maybe I zoned out, even though I sit in the front row). That part was the only mistake I made in the lab exam, (which cost me a considerate amount of points ðŸ˜‚).

My main concern is that I have no real way to prepare for the labs on my own. I feel like I'm going in blind, relying solely on the teacher's explanations to avoid mistakes in the lab test. I genuinely think that not having the opportunity to prepare for the labs beforehand is unfair. If weâ€™re here to learn, why can't we prepare in advance? If the goal is to expand our knowledge, the result would be the same.

For these reasons, I kindly ask if it's possible to provide us with time to review the lab material beforehand.

Thank you for taking the time to read my concerns! I appreciate your understanding and look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Note:
I always prepare what we learn in the lecture for the lab but the questions are just specific about the written code in the lab collab notebook.
